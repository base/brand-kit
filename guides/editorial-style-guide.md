## Critical Style Conventions

### 1. **Use ‘Base’ (not BASE or Base Network)**

- Always refer to **Base** (capitalized as shown) rather than abbreviating it or using other terms like "Base Chain" or "$BASE". These alternatives may confuse the audience or reduce clarity.
- Similarly, do not refer to Base as **Base Network**, as it introduces unnecessary complexity.

### 2. **Spelling and Terminology:**

- **‘Onchain’** (not ‘on-chain’ or ‘On Chain’). This term refers to anything that happens directly on the blockchain.
- **Avoid overly technical jargon** or deep crypto terms. When necessary, simplify the language and use examples that clarify technical concepts.
- **Use ‘ETH denomination’** when talking about cryptocurrency pricing or transaction costs, emphasizing the global economy rather than USD or other fiat currencies.

### 3. **Highlight Builder-Centric Communication**

- Frequently emphasize **builders**, creators, developers, and innovators. Base’s core purpose is to empower and support the people building the decentralized future, so always frame communications with this in mind.
- **Be specific about how projects are building** on Base or benefiting from the ecosystem. Concrete examples help the audience understand the real-world impact of Base.

### 4. **Simplify Complex Ideas with Analogies and Examples**

- **Avoid technical overwhelm**. Use metaphors, analogies, or relatable examples to explain abstract concepts. For example, comparing smart contracts to automated vending machines or explaining gas fees by comparing them to transaction fees on traditional networks.

## Writing Guidelines

### 1. **Focus on Clarity and Brevity**

- Write clearly and concisely to ensure the message is digestible for both technical and non-technical audiences. 
- Use **active voice** whenever possible. Active voice is direct and straightforward (e.g., "Base empowers builders" vs. "Builders are empowered by Base").
- Avoid excessive **complex vocabulary**. Use **plain language** to make the content accessible to a wider audience.

### 2. **Be Direct but Human**

- Base’s voice should be approachable. You can be **witty** and **engaging**, but always remain clear.
- Make sure your writing **sounds human** and relatable. Use contractions (e.g., “we’re” instead of “we are”) and keep the tone conversational but professional.
- Avoid jargon-heavy language that can confuse readers who may not be experts in blockchain or decentralized technologies.

### 3. **Emphasize Progress**

- Base is always evolving. Highlight **recent milestones** or updates, and outline upcoming plans. 
- Celebrate small wins in addition to large accomplishments to show continuous movement and commitment to the long-term vision.
  
### 4. **Tone Should Reflect Our Optimism**

- **Optimistic, yet realistic**: While it’s important to maintain an optimistic tone about the future of the decentralized web, also acknowledge challenges and obstacles.
- **Appreciative and inclusive**: Always acknowledge contributions from the community, recognizing the role everyone plays in Base’s growth.
  
### 5. **Celebrate Community and Builders**

- Feature **builders, developers, and artists**—they are the heart of Base. Regularly highlight their projects, ideas, and achievements.
- Make sure to include **user stories** or **case studies** that show how people are using Base and how it's enabling them to achieve great things.

## Tone and Voice

### Voice

Base's voice should be consistent across all communications:

- **Progressive** and **forward-thinking**
- **Human** and **approachable**
- **Direct** (use simple, straightforward language)
- **Optimistic but grounded** (acknowledge the challenges while highlighting the possibilities)
- **Appreciative** (don’t come off as overly boastful, but show gratitude)
- **Relatable** (engage with the audience by connecting ideas to their everyday experiences)

Example of voice:

“Base is about giving builders the tools they need to change the world. Whether you're creating the next big DApp or making decentralized finance more accessible, we’re here to help you make it happen.”

### Tone

Base's tone will change depending on the context and the audience, but it will always be:

- **Clear and concise** (no unnecessary words)
- **Friendly but not casual** (we're approachable but professional)
- **Engaging** (keep the reader interested, avoid monotony)
- **Solutions-focused** (emphasize how Base solves problems and makes things better)
- **Human-centric** (keep the community at the forefront)
  
Example of tone:

- In a **community update**: "We’re thrilled to share some exciting progress — we’ve just launched new tools for developers that will make it easier to build on Base. Dive in and start creating today."
- In a **technical blog**: "Let’s explore how Base’s modular architecture ensures scalability without compromising security."

### The Golden Rule for Voice and Tone

When writing for Base, always ask yourself:

- **Does it feel like it's coming from a human at Base?**
- **Is the message clear, simple, and solution-oriented?**
- **Is it inclusive and empowering to the community?**

## Common Writing Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **Financial Terminology and Hype**

- Refrain from using language that could be construed as making financial predictions, such as **“get rich quick”** or **“high yield”**. Base focuses on empowering users and builders, not on financial gain.
  
### 2. **Overuse of Acronyms and Jargon**

- Avoid using too many abbreviations or overly technical terms that may alienate a non-technical audience. Always aim to explain terms when introducing them.

### 3. **Superlatives and Hyperbole**

- Avoid exaggerated statements such as **“world’s best”**, **“largest ever”**, or **“groundbreaking”** unless they are factually verified. Instead, focus on specific achievements.

### 4. **Aggressive Marketing Language**

- Do not engage in pushy or overly aggressive marketing tactics. Base should come across as **helpful**, not as a sales-driven organization. For example, avoid terms like "this is the only platform you’ll ever need."

### 5. **Negative Comparisons**

- Never disparage other projects, competitors, or protocols. Base’s value should shine on its own merit, not by putting others down.

## Number and Punctuation Guidelines

1. **Use the Oxford Comma**: Always include a comma before the final conjunction in a list (e.g., "apples, oranges, and bananas").
   
2. **Use Em Dashes with Spaces**: Place spaces around em dashes (—), for example: “This is an exciting update — we’ve hit a milestone — and we want you to be part of it.”

3. **Numerals for 10 and Above**: Use numerals for numbers 10 and above, but spell out numbers one through nine.
   - Correct: “There are 10 new developers working on Base.”
   - Incorrect: “There are Ten new developers working on Base.”

4. **Use “K” for Thousands, “M” for Millions**: For simplicity and brevity:
   - 100K (for 100,000)
   - 1M (for 1,000,000)
  
5. **Time and Date Formats**:
   - Use both **AM/PM** and **Time Zone** (e.g., 3:00 PM EST).
   - Write **dates** as "14 January 2025", not "January 14, 2025."

## Final Thoughts

- Base’s content should always strive to **educate** and **empower** the community, rather than simply inform.
- Each piece of content should feel like part of a larger conversation, pushing the boundaries of decentralized technology while staying grounded in real-world applications.

**Follow these guidelines**, and you’ll help build a consistent, powerful, and inspiring Base brand.
